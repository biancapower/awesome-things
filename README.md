# Awesome Things

### Fun terminal games / tutorials

* [Webminal's Terminal tutorials](http://www.webminal.org/)
* [Command Line Murder Mystery](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery)
* [Terminus - a Command Line Text Adventure in the browser](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)

### Quick reference docs on the command line

The `man` command is super useful, but often gives more detail than is needed to get started with a tool or to remember its basic usage. The tools below provide quick access to similar info in a friendlier format.

* [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr): simplified and community-driven man pages
* [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh): curl a cheatsheet for just about anything, from terminal commands to docker to language specific things. The "learn" option gives a really neat overview of a programming language (e.g. `curl cheat.sh/javascript/:learn` ).  `curl cheat.sh/:intro` gives an overview
